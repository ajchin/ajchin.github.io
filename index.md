## about

I am currently a fifth year PhD student at Stanford in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) working with [Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/).

On the methodology front, I am interested in the inferential challenges posed by complex data generating processes, such as those found in social science settings.  Toward that end I have mostly worked on techniques for testing and estimation in the presence of interference and spillover effects using tools from causal inference and machine learning.
On the engineering front, I am interested in building scalable, production-quality data science software that enables companies to achieve their business objectives.


## research

A. Chin, D. Eckles, and J. Ugander, Evaluating stochastic seeding strategies in networks, September 2018.  [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.09561)]

* Better design and analysis of experiments for comparing seeding strategies.

A. Chin, Regression adjustments for estimating the global treatment effect in experiments with interference, August 2018.  [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08683)]

* An approach to removing bias in the presence of interference that relies on regression adjustments rather than exposure models or graph clustering.

A. Chin, Central limit theorems via Stein's method for randomized experiments under interference, April 2018. [[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03105)]

* Methods for establishing CLTs for treatment effect estimators under the dependencies implied by interference.

## work experience

#### Data Science R&D Intern, [Civis Analytics](https://www.civisanalytics.com/), Chicago, IL, Summer 2018
I worked on a platform for measuring the effectiveness of political ads.

#### Core Data Science Intern, [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/), Menlo Park, CA, Summer 2017
I worked with the Experimental Design and Causal Inference team to optimize design and analysis for dyad-level experiments.

#### Modeling Scientist Intern, [Quantcast](https://www.quantcast.com/), San Francisco, CA, Summer 2016
I built a MapReduce expectation-maximization system for training large mixture classification models.

## education

Before coming to Stanford, I was a [Park Scholar](https://park.ncsu.edu/) at NC State.  I also spent a semester studying math in [Budapest, Hungary](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/).

* Ph.D Statistics, Stanford University, *expected 2019*
* B.S. Mathematics, NC State University, 2014
* B.S. Economics, NC State University, 2014
* Minor in Linguistics, NC State University, 2014
