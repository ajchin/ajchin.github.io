## about

I am currently a fifth year PhD student at Stanford in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) working with [Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/).



## research

A. Chin, [Regression adjustments for estimating the global treatment effect in experiments with interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08683), August 2018.
* An approach to removing bias in the presence of interference that relies on regression adjustments rather than exposure models or graph clustering.

A. Chin, [Central limit theorems via Stein's method for randomized experiments under interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03105), April 2018.
* Methods for establishing CLTs for treatment effect estimators under the dependencies implied by interference.

## teaching

I have TA'd the following courses at Stanford:

* stats 305c: PhD applied statistics, Spring 2018
* stats 305a: PhD applied statistics, Autumn 2017 and Autumn 2018
* stats 231: theory of machine learning, Spring 2017
* stats 216: introduction to statistical learning, Summer 2015 and Winter 2016
* stats 200: introduction to statistical inference, Autumn 2016
* stats 191: introduction to applied statistics, Winter 2015

* stats 50: mathematics of sports, Spring 2016


## work experience

#### Data Science R&D Intern, [Civis Analytics](https://www.civisanalytics.com/), Chicago, IL, Summer 2018
I worked on building a media attribution and optimization platform for both political and commercial applications.

#### Core Data Science Intern, [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/), Menlo Park, CA, Summer 2017
I worked with the Experimental Design and Causal Inference team to optimize design and analysis for dyad-level experiments.  I presented my work at the [2017 Conference on Digital Experimentation](http://ide.mit.edu/sites/default/files/agendas/CODE%202017%20Agenda.pdf).

#### Modeling Scientist Intern, [Quantcast](https://www.quantcast.com/), San Francisco, CA, Summer 2016
I built a MapReduce expectation-maximization system for training large mixture classification models.

## education

Before coming to Stanford, I was a [Park Scholar](https://park.ncsu.edu/) at NC State.  I also spent a semester studying math in [Budapest, Hungary](https://www.budapestsemesters.com/).

* Ph.D Statistics, Stanford University, *expected* 2019
* B.S. Mathematics, NC State University, 2014
* B.S. Economics, NC State University, 2014
* Minor in Linguistics, NC State University, 2014
