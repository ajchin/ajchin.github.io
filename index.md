## about

I am currently a fifth-year PhD student at Stanford in the [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) working with [Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/).
<!---I completed my PhD in [Statistics](https://statistics.stanford.edu/) at Stanford in March 2019, working with [Johan Ugander](https://web.stanford.edu/~jugander/).  My [thesis](thesis-augmented.pdf) was on causal inference under interference.  -->

Methodology-wise, I am interested in the inferential challenges posed by complex data generating processes. My expertise in this domain includes causal inference, machine learning, and experimental design. Engineering-wise, I am interested in building scalable, end-to-end, production-quality data science software. I like to focus on combining these methodology and engineering skillsets to tackle challenging problems and build impactful data science product solutions.

<!---Here is my [CV](alex-chin-cv.pdf).--->

## work experience

#### Data Science R&D Intern, [Civis Analytics](https://www.civisanalytics.com/), Chicago, IL, Summer 2018
I worked on a platform for measuring the effectiveness of political ads.

#### Core Data Science Intern, [Facebook](https://research.fb.com/category/data-science/), Menlo Park, CA, Summer 2017
I worked with the Experimental Design and Causal Inference team to optimize design and analysis for dyad-level experiments.

#### Modeling Scientist Intern, [Quantcast](https://www.quantcast.com/), San Francisco, CA, Summer 2016
I built a MapReduce expectation-maximization system for training large mixture classification models.
